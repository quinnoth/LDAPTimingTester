LDAPTimingTester
==============

A small winforms tool to run LDAP queries and output the response time

This requires the Novell .NET Library to operate (downlaod from here: https://www.novell.com/developer/ndk/ldap_libraries_for_c_sharp.html)

Disclaimer: This is just a quick test tool for something I was working on, so expect bugs and poor code in the application.
